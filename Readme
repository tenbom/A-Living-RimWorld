NOTES...

For a terrain to have plants on it, it HAS TO have a fertility value in the XML.  So to add plants to water, you would...
1. Give the specific type of water you want plants on (waterShallow, waterShallowMoving, whatever) a fertility value
2. If you only want a few specific plants on the terrain, give it a <tags> <li> onlyTaggedPlants </li> </tags>
3. Give the plants to grow on it a tag with the terrain's defName (in the XML).  The plant will now only be placed on the listed terrains.

TAGS
  Terrain Tags	-  tags for changing the way a terrain type chooses its' plants (usefull for water)
  added to a terrain in the following form...
	<tags>
		<li>noPlants</li>           //(no matter the fertility, plant nothing)
		<li>onlyTaggedPlants</li>   //(no matter the fertility, only plant plants with tags for this terrain type)
	</tags>
    
  Plant Tags    - added to a plant in the following form...
  		Decription: causes a plant to only be planted on the listed terrain types
	<thingSetMakerTags>
		<li>WaterShallow</li>       (the defName of a terrain, as writtin in the XML)
