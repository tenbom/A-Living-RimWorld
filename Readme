NOTES...

For a terrain to have plants on it, it HAS TO have a fertility value in the XML.  So to add plants to water, you would...
1. Give the specific type of water you want plants on (waterShallow, waterShallowMoving, whatever) a fertility value
2. If you only want a couple specific plants on that terrain, give the terain a tag, <tags> <li>onlyTaggedPlants</li> </tags>
3. Determine which plants to grow on the terrain.  Give each plant tags with the terrain's defNames (in the XML).  
   The plant will now then be placed on the tagged terrains.

TAGS
  Terrain Tags should be formated like...
	<tags>
		<li>noPlants</li>           //(no matter the fertility, plant nothing)
		<li>onlyTaggedPlants</li>   //(no matter the fertility, only plant plants with tags for this terrain type)
	</tags>
    
  Plant Tags should be formated like...	- 
	<thingSetMakerTags>
		<li>WaterShallow</li>       (the defName of a terrain, as writtin in the XML)
		<li>WaterOceanShallow</li>
	</thingSetMakerTags>
   note: having a <thingSetMakerTags> tag on a plant will cause the plant to be placed ONLY ON the tagged terrain types, 
         no other terrain will have the plant
