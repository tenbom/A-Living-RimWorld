TAGS
For a terrain to have plants on it, it HAS TO have a fertility value in the XML.  So to add plants to water, you would...
1. Give the specific type of water you want plants on (waterShallow, waterShallowMoving, whatever) a fertility value
	I might be able to work around (1.) in the future.
2. If you only want a couple specific plants on that terrain, give the terain a tag, <tags> <li>onlyTaggedPlants</li> </tags>
3. Determine which plants to grow on the terrain.  Give each plant tags with the terrain's defNames (in the XML).  
   The plant will now be placed on the tagged terrains.


  Terrain Tags should be formated like...
	<tags>
		<li>noPlants</li>           //(no matter the fertility, plant nothing)
		<li>onlyTaggedPlants</li>   //(no matter the fertility, only plant plants with tags for this terrain type)
	</tags>
    
  Plant Tags should be formated like...	- 
	<thingSetMakerTags>
		<li>WaterShallow</li>       (the defName of a terrain, as writtin in the XML)
		<li>WaterOceanShallow</li>
	</thingSetMakerTags>
   note: having a <thingSetMakerTags> tag on a plant will cause the plant to be placed ONLY ON its tagged terrain types, 
         no other terrain will have the plant
	POSSIBLE BUGS...
		Plant respawning, if they keep the same terrain-based seperation
		Plant quantity, plant densities cause the engine to want to spawn x porportion of them over the entire map, 
			if the plant is only spawning in a small region it may spawn waaay too many
			GetDesiredPlantsCount
		Plant wildOrder, the generator first generates low order plants, then mid order, then high order plants.
			this is so less decent soil regions (mountainous, whatever) have fewer large plants.
			with extensive tagging, there may be, in terrains, drastically fewer high order (larger) plants spawning
			IF there are generally few low order plants (grass/flower) in the... map? AND the terrain is
			capable of spawning low order plants
